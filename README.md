# Lounge Queuebot
 Not to be confused with squad queues, this bot will replace MogiBot in Lounge.
 
 Players will join a single queue for RTs or a single queue for CTs. The bot will attempt to create lineups for players in the queue using certain criteria. The criteria that will determine whether a lineup should form or not includes but is not limited to:
 - Range of a potential lineup's MMR
 - How long a potential lineup's players have spent waiting in the queue
 - The number of players sitting in the main queue
 - How far away a potential lineup's average MMR is from the median MMR in Lounge
